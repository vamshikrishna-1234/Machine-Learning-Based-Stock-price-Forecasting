# Machine-Learning-Based-Stock-price-Forecasting
I did this project to utilize Deep Learning models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm to predict stock prices. We will use Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time a nd the optimal parameters for the model.
