# Machine-Learning-Based-Stock-price-Forecasting
I did this project to predict stock prices using Deep Learning models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. I used Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model.
